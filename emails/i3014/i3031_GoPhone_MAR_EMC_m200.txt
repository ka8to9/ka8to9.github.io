This is an AT&T promotional email.

A compatible phone (not a data-only device) 
is required. Not all features 
work on all phones and in all 
areas. See GoPhone User Guide 
and rate plan brochure, or go to 
http://%%track%%/alegal 
for details on coverage area, 
rates, plans, packages, terms 
and conditions and other details. 
Certain restrictions, fees, taxes, 
and charges apply, some of which 
may be deducted from your account 
balance monthly. You must be in 
the GoPhone coverage area to place 
or receive calls. Due to coverage, 
customers equipment and other 
limitations, service may not be 
accessible at all times.

Feature Packages: Packages are 
available for 30 days, as long 
as your account balance is not 
expired. Balance expiration is 
determined by date associated 
with your refill denomination. 
If your account balance expires 
before the 30th day of the feature 
package, the package cannot be used 
(and the remaining time on the 
package will continue to run) unless 
you refill your account during the 
remaining days of the package period. 
The day you add the package is counted 
as a full day and counts towards 
the 30 days. Package expires at 12 
am Central Time on day 30. After 30-day 
package expires or package is depleted, 
usage will be charged according to 
your underlying rate plan.

Limited Feature Packages: A package 
that contains a specific allotment 
of International airtime minutes, 
data (in megabytes) or messages is 
depleted when you use the entire 
allotment. Renew package before 
30-day period expires and any unused 
service will roll over to your new 
30-day package period.
